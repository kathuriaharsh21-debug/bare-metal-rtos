/*! \class SwitchStrategyEDF
    \brief Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling strategy: always selects the runnable
           task with the least time remaining before its deadline expires.

    \par Selection metric
    GetNext() compares each runnable task's \e relative deadline, obtained via
    \c IKernelTask::GetHrtRelativeDeadline() = \c deadline - \c duration (ticks remaining
    before the task must complete and call Yield()). The task with the \b minimum relative
    deadline, i.e. the one closest to missing its deadline is selected.

    \par HRT mode requirement
    This strategy is only meaningful when used with \c KERNEL_HRT mode. In HRT mode the
    kernel tracks \c duration (active ticks elapsed) per task, making
    \c GetHrtRelativeDeadline() produce meaningful, monotonically decreasing values.
    Outside HRT mode \c GetHrtRelativeDeadline() returns 0 for every task, making
    selection order arbitrary.

    \par Tie-breaking
    When two or more tasks share the same relative deadline the first such task encountered
    during the linear scan of \c m_tasks wins. Insertion order therefore determines tie
    priority. This behaviour is implementation-defined and not guaranteed to remain stable
    across kernel versions.

    \par Complexity
    GetNext() performs an O(n) linear scan over all runnable tasks on every call (once per
    kernel tick). This is inherent to EDF: unlike fixed-priority strategies there is no
    O(1) data structure that maintains a sorted deadline order under arbitrary insertions
    and removals without additional memory cost.

    \note  This strategy does not use per-task weights (WEIGHT_API = 0). The EDF deadline
           is tracked internally by the kernel in \c KERNEL_HRT mode, tasks do not need to
           override \c ITask::GetWeight().
    \note  Requires the kernel Sleep API (SLEEP_EVENT_API = 1): the kernel must call
           OnTaskSleep() and OnTaskWake() to maintain the runnable/sleeping list split.
    \note  Unlike SwitchStrategyRoundRobin and SwitchStrategyFixedPriority, EDF maintains
           no per-task cursor. Task insertion and removal do not update any scheduling state
           beyond the list membership, all scheduling decisions are deferred to GetNext().
