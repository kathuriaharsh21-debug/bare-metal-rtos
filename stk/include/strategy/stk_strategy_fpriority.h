/*! \class SwitchStrategyFixedPriority
    \brief Fixed-priority preemptive scheduling strategy with round-robin arbitration
           within each priority level.

    \tparam MAX_PRIORITIES  Number of distinct priority levels. Must be in the range [1, 32]
                            (enforced by a compile-time assertion). Bit \c i of the 32-bit
                            \c m_ready_bitmap represents priority level \c i.
                            The concrete alias SwitchStrategyFP32 uses MAX_PRIORITIES = 32.

    \par Priority assignment
    Each task's priority is read from \c ITask::GetWeight(), cast to \c uint8_t, and must
    be in the range [0, MAX_PRIORITIES - 1]. Tasks do \b not use the dynamic current-weight
    mechanism, the static weight value \e is the priority. Configure a task's priority by
    overriding \c ITask::GetWeight() to return the desired level.

    \par Scheduling rules
    - The highest runnable priority level is always selected. A task at priority \c N will
      never run while any task at priority > \c N is runnable.
    - Tasks at the same priority level are scheduled in round-robin order (one tick slice
      each), using a per-level cursor (\c m_prev[prio]).
    - Higher numeric value = higher priority. 0 is the lowest, MAX_PRIORITIES - 1 is highest.

    \par Priority detection — O(1) bitmap
    \c m_ready_bitmap is a 32-bit bitmask where bit \c i is set whenever priority level \c i
    has at least one runnable task. GetNext() and GetFirst() locate the highest set bit in
    O(1) via \c __builtin_clz (GCC/Clang) or a portable 32->0 scan fallback. The bitmap is
    kept consistent by AddActive() (bit set) and RemoveActive() (bit cleared on last removal).

    \note  Uses the Weight API (WEIGHT_API = 1): \c GetWeight() is interpreted as the task's
           fixed priority level. The dynamic weight functions (SetCurrentWeight /
           GetCurrentWeight) are \b not used by this strategy.
    \note  Requires the kernel Sleep API (SLEEP_EVENT_API = 1): OnTaskSleep() and OnTaskWake()
           maintain the per-priority runnable lists and keep \c m_ready_bitmap accurate.
