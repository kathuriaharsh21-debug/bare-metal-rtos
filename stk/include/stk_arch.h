    \brief Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) declarations for the \c stk::hw namespace.

    Selects and includes the correct architecture back-end header based on the active
    architecture macro (_STK_ARCH_ARM_CORTEX_M, _STK_ARCH_RISC_V, _STK_ARCH_X86_WIN32),
    then declares the portable \c stk::hw interface that the rest of the kernel uses:
     - Thread-local storage (TLS) read/write: GetTls, SetTls, GetTlsPtr, SetTlsPtr.
     - ISR context detection: IsInsideISR.
     - Preemption control: CriticalSection (nestable, single-core) and SpinLock (SMP).
     - Lock-free 64-bit volatile I/O: ReadVolatile64, WriteVolatile64.
*/

// Architecture back-end selection.
// Exactly one of the following macros must be defined by the build system (e.g. via -D compiler flag):
//   _STK_ARCH_ARM_CORTEX_M  — ARM Cortex-M (M0/M0+/M3/M4/M7/M33/M55).
//   _STK_ARCH_RISC_V        — RISC-V (RV32I/RV32E/RV64, with optional FPU).
//   _STK_ARCH_X86_WIN32     — x86/x64 on Windows (simulation/test use only).
//
// Defining more than one is not supported and will result in multiple conflicting definitions.
// _STK_ARCH_DEFINED is set by whichever back-end is included; it can be tested by downstream
// headers or build checks to verify that a valid architecture was selected.

    \brief Nestable, SMP-safe critical section that combines local interrupt masking with a

    \note  \b Mechanism (two-layer protocol):
           -# Local interrupts are masked on the calling core (via PRIMASK / CPSID on Cortex-M,
              or equivalent on other architectures) to prevent re-entrant ISR access on this core.
           -# A global spinlock (\c g_CsuLock) is then acquired to block any other core from
              entering the same critical section concurrently.
           On Enter() the spinlock is only acquired at nesting depth 0 so that nested Enter()
           calls from the same core do not deadlock. On Exit(), the spinlock is released and
           interrupts are restored only when the outermost Exit() brings the nesting counter
           back to zero.
    \note  \b SMP support: safe across multiple cores. The global spinlock ensures that only one
           core at a time can hold the section, regardless of interrupt state on other cores.
           On RP2040, the global lock is a hardware SIO peripheral spinlock rather than a
           software atomic, providing the cross-core guarantee with no software polling overhead
           until contention occurs.
    \note  \b Unprivileged mode: on Cortex-M targets with TrustZone / privilege separation,
           Enter() and Exit() escalate via SVC when called from an unprivileged thread, so the
           mechanism works correctly in both privileged and unprivileged task contexts.
    \note  Keep critical sections as short as possible. Every cycle spent holding the section
           blocks all other cores and increases interrupt latency, which can cause missed
           deadlines in HRT mode.
