/*! \class SwitchStrategySmoothWeightedRoundRobin
    \brief Smooth Weighted Round-Robin (SWRR) task-switching strategy: distributes CPU time
           proportionally to per-task weights while avoiding execution bursts by spreading
           selections evenly over time.

    This is an improved variant of standard Weighted Round-Robin.
    \see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_round_robin

    \par Algorithm
    Each task carries two weight values:
     - <b>Static weight</b> (`GetWeight()`): configured by the application via ITask::GetWeight().
       Defines the task's desired CPU share relative to other tasks. Must be a positive 24-bit
       integer (1 .. 0x7FFFFF). A task with weight 3 receives three times as much CPU time as
       one with weight 1.
     - <b>Dynamic (current) weight</b> (`GetCurrentWeight()` / `SetCurrentWeight()`): modified
       each scheduling step by the algorithm below. Starts at 0 when a task is added.

    On every call to GetNext() (once per kernel tick):
    -# For every runnable task: `current_weight += static_weight`
    -# Select the task with the highest `current_weight` as the next to run.
    -# For the selected task only: `current_weight -= total_weight_sum`
       (where `total_weight_sum` is the sum of static weights of all \e runnable tasks).

    Over time this produces fair, proportional CPU distribution without consecutive bursts.

    \par Wake-up priority boost
    When a sleeping task is woken (OnTaskWake()), its `current_weight` is set to
    `total_weight_sum` so it is selected on the very next tick. This prevents starvation
    of tasks that had been blocking on I/O or synchronization objects.

    \note  Requires the Weight API (WEIGHT_API = 1): the kernel must provide `GetWeight()`,
           `GetCurrentWeight()`, and `SetCurrentWeight()` on each kernel task.
    \note  Requires the kernel Sleep API (SLEEP_EVENT_API = 1): the kernel must call
           OnTaskSleep() and OnTaskWake() to keep \c m_total_weight consistent as tasks
           enter and leave the runnable set.
    \note  GetNext() iterates over all runnable tasks — O(n) per tick. For large task counts
           the constant factor is small (integer arithmetic only), but this should be considered
           when sizing TASKS_MAX on severely constrained targets.
