/*! \class SwitchStrategyRoundRobin
    \brief Round-Robin task-switching strategy: each runnable task receives one time slice
           (one tick interval) in turn before the kernel moves to the next task.

    Internally maintains two intrusive lists:
     - \c m_tasks — tasks currently eligible for scheduling (runnable).
     - \c m_sleep — tasks that called Sleep() or are otherwise blocked.

    The iterator cursor (\c m_prev) points to the most recently scheduled task. On each
    call to GetNext() the cursor advances by one position in \c m_tasks, wrapping around
    at the end (closed-loop list). When \c m_tasks is empty, GetNext() returns \c nullptr
    and the kernel transitions to the sleep trap.

    \note  All runnable tasks receive equal CPU time regardless of creation order or any
           other factor. There is no priority or weight mechanism in this strategy
           (WEIGHT_API = 0).
    \note  Requires the kernel Sleep API (SLEEP_EVENT_API = 1): the kernel must call
           OnTaskSleep() and OnTaskWake() when a task's sleep state changes.
