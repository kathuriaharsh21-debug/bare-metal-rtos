/*! \file  stk_linked_list.h
    \brief Intrusive doubly-linked list implementation used internally by the kernel.

    Provides two class templates:
     - DListEntry<T, TClosedLoop>: the node embedded inside a host object (T).
     - DListHead<T, TClosedLoop>:  the list container that owns and traverses the nodes.

    The list is \e intrusive: the link pointers live inside the host object itself,
    so no separate heap allocation is required for list membership.
    A single host object may belong to at most one list at a time.

    The \c TClosedLoop template parameter selects between two structural variants:
     - \c false: open (linear) list — first->prev and last->next are \c NULL.
     - \c true:  closed (circular) list — first->prev points to last and
                 last->next points to first, enabling O(1) wrap-around traversal.

/*! \class DListEntry
    \brief Intrusive doubly-linked list node. Embed this as a base class in any object (T)
           that needs to participate in a DListHead list.

    \tparam T:           The host class that derives from DListEntry. Used by the implicit
                         conversion operators to safely downcast the node pointer back to the
                         host object pointer without a dynamic_cast.
    \tparam TClosedLoop: When \c true the list is kept circular (last->next == first and
                         first->prev == last). When \c false the list is linear (boundary
                         pointers are \c NULL). Must match the \c TClosedLoop of the
                         DListHead this entry will be inserted into.

    \note  An entry that is not currently in any list has \c m_head == \c NULL.
           Use IsLinked() to test membership before calling any DListHead operation.
    \note  A single DListEntry instance may belong to at most one DListHead at a time.
           Inserting a linked entry into a second list without first removing it from the
           first will trigger an assertion.
    \note  Not thread-safe. The caller is responsible for protecting list operations
           with a hw::CriticalSection or equivalent.
